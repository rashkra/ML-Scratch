# ML-Scratch
ML Algorithms in Python from Scratch as well as with library use.
The objective of this project is to model various data using different ML Algorithms.
The Algorithms here are coded from scratch so as to understand the Maths behind each and every algorithm.
Python3 is used for programming purpose.
